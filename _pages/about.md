Hi. I am currently in the fourth year of my Ph.D. studies at the Hunan University, specializing in Pattern Recognition and Computer Vision under the supervision of Prof. [Yaonan Wang](http://eeit.hnu.edu.cn/info/1277/4490.htm) and Pro. [Min Liu](http://eeit.hnu.edu.cn/info/1291/5218.htm). Most recently, I am interested in the following topics:
- Image Retrieval
- Adversarial Attack
- Vision Language Models
